    <h1>CSS - The Fundamentals</h1>
<p>Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about boxes. This includes setting size, color, and position. Most HTML elements on your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of other boxes.

<p>CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space on your page has properties like:
    
    <ul>
        <li>padding : the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.</li>
        <li>border : the solid line that is just outside the padding.</li>
        <li>margin : the space around the outside of the border.</li>
        <li>width : how wide the element should be</li>
        <li>background-color : the color behind an element's content and padding.</li>
        <li>color : the color of an element's content (usually text).</li>
        <li>text-shadow : sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.</li>
        <li>display : sets the display mode of an element. (keep reading to learn more)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
